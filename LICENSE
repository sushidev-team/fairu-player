      - Using the player with self-hosted media files
      - Using the player with third-party CDNs or hosting services for your
        own content

      - Using the player as part of a larger application that is not primarily
        a media player service
      - Internal use within organizations
      - Educational and research purposes
      - Open source projects that do not compete with fairu.app

      required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
      the Licensed Work.

3. Patents

   If you bring a patent claim against the Licensor (including any claim,
   cross-claim, or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Licensed Work
   infringes a patent, then any patent licenses granted to you under this
   License for the Licensed Work shall terminate as of the date such patent
   claim is filed.

   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright
   license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display,
